# Capstone-2024
 We developed a text-to-image pipeline for AI-generated synthetic images using Fastai and Stable Diffusion. Upon prompting, the model generates synthetic images with the choice of augmentation.
  We built a GAN using a UNet learner with the backbone of resnet-34 which resulted accuracy of 94%. The resultant images were used to train the discriminator. This was a Capstone Project for the Final Year of Engineering. 
  We deployed it on AWS using Streamlit.
